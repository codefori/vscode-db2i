### Server Component

As of 0.3.0, the Db2 for i extension requires a server component. The component provides improved performance and makes it easy for us to add better features. The extension will manage the server component installation when you connect to a system with Code for IBM i. [The server component is also open-source](https://github.com/ThePrez/CodeForIBMiServer).
